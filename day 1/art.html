    <h1>Kazimir Malevich</h1>
    <p>Kazimir Malevich was one of the greaters artists of the beggining of the XX century. Maybe one of the greatest of all times.</p>
    <p>I am a huge fan of his work in art and in art theory. Another thing in his biography that I realy admire is his anarchic political views and how it is connected with his concepts or art and the function of that art in society.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>“Art no longer cares to serve the state and religion, it no longer wishes to illustrate the history of manners, it wants to have nothing further to do with the object, as such, and believes that it can exist, in and for itself, without "things" (that is, the "time-tested well-spring of life").”</p>
        <cite>Kasimir Malevich, The non-objective world </cite>
    </blockquote>
    <p>So I decided to create here a small "exibition" of his work. It makes my exercise of coding more fun and usefull to my understanding of the possibilities of coding!</p>
